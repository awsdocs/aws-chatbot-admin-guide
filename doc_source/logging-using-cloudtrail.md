# Logging AWS Chatbot API calls with AWS CloudTrail<a name="logging-using-cloudtrail"></a>

AWS Chatbot integrates events with AWS CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in AWS Chatbot\. CloudTrail captures API calls for AWS Chatbot as events\. The calls captured include calls from the AWS Chatbot console and code calls to the AWS Chatbot API operations\. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for AWS Chatbot\. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in **Event history**\. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to AWS Chatbot, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details\. For more information, see [Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.html)\. 

To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to configure and enable it, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/)\.

When you create a *trail*, you can enable continuous delivery of AWS Chatbot events to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify\. The trail logs events from all Regions in the AWS partition for that service and delivers the log files to that Amazon S3 bucket\. You can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon the event data collected in CloudTrail logs\. For more information, see the following topics in the *AWS CloudTrail User Guide*:

## Logging AWS Chatbot API information in CloudTrail<a name="service-name-info-in-cloudtrail"></a>

Every event log entry contains information about who generated the request\. The identity information helps you determine the following: 
+ Whether the request was made with root user or IAM user credentials\.
+ Whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for a role or for a federated user\.
+ Whether the request was made by another AWS service\.

For more information, see the [CloudTrail userIdentity Element](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.html)\.

## Logging other AWS API information in CloudTrail<a name="other-apis-in-cloudtrail"></a>

When you use commands in AWS Chatbot that call APIs from other AWS services, those APIs are logged in CloudTrail as well\.

When you run a command that involves another AWS service, AWS Chatbot assumes an IAM role in your account to invoke AWS APIs on your behalf\. These APIs appear in your CloudTrail events, and they are associated with the role that was configured for your AWS Chatbot configuration with a session name that includes **chatbot**, such as **chatbot\-session**\.

Because AWS Chatbot is a global service, it may process your events in a different AWS Region\. An API call is logged in the region where the resource behind that API call exists\. For example, if you run a `lambda list-functions` command in AWS Chatbot, CloudTrail will log two APIs: **AssumeRole** and **ListFunctions**\. The **AssumeRole** call is logged in the region AWS Chatbot processed it in, and the **ListFunctions** call is logged in the region the function exists in\. 

## Example: AWS Chatbot log file entries<a name="understanding-service-name-entries"></a>

CloudTrail log files contain one or more log entries\. An event represents a single request from any source and includes information about the requested action, the date and time of the action, request parameters, user identification, and more\. CloudTrail log files aren't an ordered stack trace of the public API calls, so they don't appear in any specific order\.

The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry for the AWS Chatbot `DescribeSlackChannels` action\.
