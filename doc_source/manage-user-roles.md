# Managing user roles<a name="manage-user-roles"></a>

All users can manage user roles:
+ Channel members can switch their user roles from their chat channels\. Additionally, channel members can unmap user roles from chat client IDs using the AWS Chatbot console\.
+ Administrators can unmap user roles from channel members' chat client IDs from the **User permissions** page in the AWS Chatbot console\. Administrators can also require user roles by enabling a user role requirement in the **User permissions** page\. This requirement can be applied to all workspaces and channels or to individual channel configurations\. For more information on user role requirements, see [User role requirement](understanding-permissions.md#role-reqs)\.

**Note**  
Administrators can't map user roles\. Only channel members have this ability\.
